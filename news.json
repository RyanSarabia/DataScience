On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck.

The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons.

Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

        "full_article": "The European Union authorized use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on Thursday, amid mounting frustration with a sluggish inoculation campaign that has been hobbled by supply shocks and logistics failures, and with global wars over scarce doses ratcheting up.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, issued the authorization a few hours after the 27-member bloc\u2019s main drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, approved the vaccine for use in people 18 and up.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can be stored in regular fridges for up to three months and only requires one shot, is the fourth to be approved by the regulatory agency. Three more vaccines, Novavax, CureVac and Sputnik V, are undergoing a rolling review, a preliminary step that could lead to approval. The decision on Thursday opens the door for the delivery of 200 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the European Union, under a contract that includes an option for 200 million more.Those supplies could help speed up the bloc\u2019s vaccination efforts, which have gotten off to a sluggish start. So far, only 6.5 percent of the European Union\u2019s 450 million residents have been inoculated, far behind the rates in Britain, Israel or the United States.But the first deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccine are not expected in Europe before April. The bloc also said on Thursday that it would extend for another three months, to the end of June, a mechanism that permits member states to prevent the export of vaccines made within the bloc\u2019s borders if the manufacturers have not filled all their orders at home. Data published Wednesday by The New York Times showed that the European Union has been exporting millions of vaccine doses, even as member nations\u2019 efforts to vaccinate their own citizens have been slowed by shortages and other problems.The bloc has come under fierce criticism over the mechanism to restrict exports. Accusations of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d intensified last week when Italy used the mechanism to block a shipment of doses bound for Australia.Since the mechanism was put in place in February, officials have approved 249 export permits, covering more than 34 million doses bound for 31 different countries. They were approved \u201cbecause they did not threaten the contractual arrangement between the E.U. and the vaccine producers,\u201d said Miriam Garc\u00eda Ferrer, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. \u201cOnly one export has been refused,\u201d she added.",

Their tomb was an ovoid jar beneath the floor of a grand hall in an expansive hilltop complex known as La Almoloya, in what is now Murcia, Spain. It\u2019s one of many archaeological sites associated with the El Argar culture of the Early Bronze Age that controlled an area about the size of Belgium from 2200 B.C. to 1500 B.C.Judging by the 29 high-value objects in the tomb, described Thursday in the journal Antiquity, the couple appear to have been members of the Argaric upper class. And the woman may have been the more important of the two, raising questions for archaeologists about who wielded power among the Argarics, and adding more evidence to a debate about the role of women in prehistoric Europe.She died in her 20s, possibly of tuberculosis, and had been placed on her back with her legs bent toward the man. In life, she had a range of congenital anomalies such as a shortened, fused spine and a stunted left thumb.On and around her were sublime silver emblems of wealth and power. Her hair had been fastened with silver spirals, and her silver earlobe plugs \u2014 one larger than the other \u2014 had silver spirals looped through them. A silver bracelet was near her elbow, and a silver ring was still on her finger. Silver embellished the diamond-shaped ceramic pot near her, and triple plates of silver embellished her oak-wood awl \u2014 a symbol of womanhood.Her most fantastic silver artifact is an impeccably crafted diadem \u2014 a headband-like crown \u2014 that still rested on her head. Only six have been discovered in Argaric graves.ImageThe interior of the La Almoloya grave.

You could actually see yourself in the disc. Framing the eyes of that woman, it would be a very, very impressive thing to see. And the ability of somebody to be reflected \u2014 their face in another face \u2014 would have been something shocking.\u201dThe sound of her would have been dramatic too: \u201cThink about the noise \u2014 this clink clink clink, because it\u2019s silver against silver in these very large earlobes,\u201d Dr. Rihuete Herrada said. \u201cThat would make for a remarkable person.\u201dThe man, who was in his 30s when he died, had been interred with his own fineries, including flared gold plugs in his ears. The silver ring that had once been on his finger had fallen off and lay near his lower back. By his side was a copper dagger fitted with four silver rivets.Like their contemporaries \u2014 such as the Minoans of Crete, the Wessex of Britain and the Unetice of Central Europe \u2014 the Argarics had the hallmarks of a state society, with a ruling bureaucracy, geopolitical boundaries, complex settlement systems and urban centers with monumental structures. They had divisions of labor and class distinctions that persisted after death, based on the wide disparity of grave goods discovered at archaeological sites.And while most of these systems have long been considered deeply patriarchal, the double burial at La Almoloya and other Argaric graves are making archaeologists reconsider life in ancient Iberia. Was she the one wielding the power? Was she a symbol of power but held none of her own? Did they share power or wield it in different realms?They were buried beneath the floor of a great hall, where long benches lined the walls, and a podium stood before a hearth meant for warmth and light, not cooking. The space was big enough to hold about 50 people. \u201cThere have been hundreds of El Argar buildings excavated, and this one is unique. It\u2019s quite clearly a building specialized in politics,\u201d Dr. Rihuete Herrada said.ImageLa Almoloya in 2015.Credit...Arqueoecologia Social Mediterr\u00e0nia Research Group, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de BarcelonaThe couple had at least one child together \u2014 an infant discovered buried beneath a nearby building was a genetic match to both of them.In the El Argar culture, girls were given grave goods at an earlier age than boys were, indicating they were considered women before boys were considered men. Diadems are exclusively found with women, and their graves hold a richer variety of valuable goods. Some male elite warriors were buried with swords.As for the power structure the two occupied, Dr. Rihuete Herrada suggests that perhaps they held potency in different realms. The swords could suggest \u201cthat enforcement of government decisions will be in the hands of men. Maybe women were political rulers, but not alone,\u201d she said.She suggests that perhaps the Argarics were similar to the matrilineal Haudenosaunee (known also as the Iroquois), with women holding political and decision-making power \u2014 including over matters of chiefdom, war and justice \u2014 but men being in control of the military.These intriguing ideas fit into an emerging body of research from various archaeological studies in Europe that are re-examining female power during the Bronze Age.\u201cThe fact that most of the grave goods, including all of those made of silver, were associated with the female clearly points to an individual that was considered highly important,\u201d said Karin Frei, a research professor in archaeometry at the National Museum of Denmark. \u201cIt makes sense to raise the question of whether a class-based state society could be ruled by women.\u201dDr. Frei is the director of Tales of Bronze Age People, which uses methods such as biogeochemical and biomolecular analyses to study the remains from both elite and commoner burials in Denmark. \u201cIn several parts of Bronze Age Europe, females might have played a much bigger role in political and/or long-distance networks than previously thought,\u201d she said.Joanna Bruck, an expert in the Bronze Age of Britain and Ireland and head of the School of Archaeology at University College Dublin, says that the assumption that elite women of this era were \u201cbartered brides,\u201d exchanged as objects in networks of male power, is ripe for reconsideration.The burial at La Almoloya \u201cprovides such clear evidence that women could hold special political power in the past,\u201d Dr. Bruck said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be open to the possibility that they wielded power and agency. Of course, power is a really complex thing. You can have power in some contexts but not in others. We shouldn\u2019t think of power being something that you have or don\u2019t have.\u201d",

That allowed him to expand eligibility to the state\u2019s next two phases at the same time \u2014 and \u201cweeks ahead of schedule.\u201dAnd at least 37 states, as well as Washington, D.C., are now allowing some residents with certain health problems to receive vaccines, according to a New York Times survey, though the conditions that confer access in one state may not do so in another.The Coronavirus Outbreak \u203aLatest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0March 18, 2021, 11:04 a.m. ETHomelessness rose for the fourth straight year, a report says, but the data doesn\u2019t yet reflect the pandemic.Europe\u2019s vaccine rollout is too slow, the W.H.O. says.A U.S. agency pledges to reimburse families for Covid-19 funeral costs.The pace of vaccinations has picked up to the point where the daily average of individual shots has reached about 2.17 million a day. On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

        "full_article": "The European Union authorized use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on Thursday, amid mounting frustration with a sluggish inoculation campaign that has been hobbled by supply shocks and logistics failures, and with global wars over scarce doses ratcheting up.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, issued the authorization a few hours after the 27-member bloc\u2019s main drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, approved the vaccine for use in people 18 and up.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can be stored in regular fridges for up to three months and only requires one shot, is the fourth to be approved by the regulatory agency. Three more vaccines, Novavax, CureVac and Sputnik V, are undergoing a rolling review, a preliminary step that could lead to approval. The decision on Thursday opens the door for the delivery of 200 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the European Union, under a contract that includes an option for 200 million more.Those supplies could help speed up the bloc\u2019s vaccination efforts, which have gotten off to a sluggish start. So far, only 6.5 percent of the European Union\u2019s 450 million residents have been inoculated, far behind the rates in Britain, Israel or the United States.But the first deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccine are not expected in Europe before April. The bloc also said on Thursday that it would extend for another three months, to the end of June, a mechanism that permits member states to prevent the export of vaccines made within the bloc\u2019s borders if the manufacturers have not filled all their orders at home. Data published Wednesday by The New York Times showed that the European Union has been exporting millions of vaccine doses, even as member nations\u2019 efforts to vaccinate their own citizens have been slowed by shortages and other problems.The bloc has come under fierce criticism over the mechanism to restrict exports. Accusations of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d intensified last week when Italy used the mechanism to block a shipment of doses bound for Australia.Since the mechanism was put in place in February, officials have approved 249 export permits, covering more than 34 million doses bound for 31 different countries. They were approved \u201cbecause they did not threaten the contractual arrangement between the E.U. and the vaccine producers,\u201d said Miriam Garc\u00eda Ferrer, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. \u201cOnly one export has been refused,\u201d she added.",

The surrounding area had no street lamps. As their bus was making a turn on a narrow, downhill stretch of the Wado-Malangbong Highway in Sumedang, West Java Province, it appears that the brakes failed, the police said.The vehicle, carrying a total of 66 people \u2014 including the students from a school in Subang, their teachers and family members \u2014 plunged into the ravine, killing 29, including the bus driver. Eleven others were seriously injured.The police were still investigating the cause of the accident, said a police spokesman, Dedi Juhana, but a lack of skid marks on the road suggested that the brakes had malfunctioned.He said that the bus had dropped some 65 feet in a valley surrounded by farmland in Sumedang. The site of the accident was a government-owned road frequently used by commuters traveling between provinces.ImageMoving one of the victims.\u00a0The vehicle had been carrying 66 people, officials said.Credit...Raisan Al Farisi/Antara Foto/Via ReutersRescue teams worked overnight to evacuate the victims. On Thursday morning, they recovered the body of a boy who had been trapped beneath the overturned bus. He died during the rescue attempt. Some survivors were sent to a nearby clinic and a hospital, and two died during treatment.Television footage showed relatives lining the halls of a hospital and a morgue in Sumedang.Budi Setiyadi, the director general of land transportation for Indonesia\u2019s transport ministry, said in a statement on Wednesday, \u201cWe express deep concern and condolences for this incident.\u201dMr. Budi said that officials were considering adding guard rails to the road or paving it as they continued to investigate the accident.Steep valleys and ravines are common along Indonesian highways because it has so much mountainous terrain. A lack of adequate street lighting and poor infrastructure lead to regular traffic accidents.On average, three people in Indonesia died every hour from road accidents in the first quarter of 2020, according to the transport ministry.The authorities said the student group had traveled some six hours from their homes to pay their respects at the tomb of Syekh Abdul Muhyi, a missionary who brought Islam to the Tasikmalaya region after the mid-17th century, when Hinduism was still the primary religion in the surrounding territory.The students, teachers and parents were visiting the site on the eve of a national holiday marking the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad.Some Muslim families visit the graves of relatives on Islamic holidays, using the occasion for outdoor picnics. While some Islamic leaders oppose the practice of pilgrimage at the burial sites of missionaries, others allow it.ImageWreckage from the accident on Thursday.Credit...Ahmad Fauzan/Associated Press",

After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

        "full_article": "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The students from an Islamic middle school were on their way home from a trip to a pilgrimage site in an Indonesian province on the island of Java.The rain was pouring on Wednesday evening. The surrounding area had no street lamps. As their bus was making a turn on a narrow, downhill stretch of the Wado-Malangbong Highway in Sumedang, West Java Province, it appears that the brakes failed, the police said.The vehicle, carrying a total of 66 people \u2014 including the students from a school in Subang, their teachers and family members \u2014 plunged into the ravine, killing 29, including the bus driver. Eleven others were seriously injured.The police were still investigating the cause of the accident, said a police spokesman, Dedi Juhana, but a lack of skid marks on the road suggested that the brakes had malfunctioned.He said that the bus had dropped some 65 feet in a valley surrounded by farmland in Sumedang. The site of the accident was a government-owned road frequently used by commuters traveling between provinces.ImageMoving one of the victims.\u00a0The vehicle had been carrying 66 people, officials said.Credit...Raisan Al Farisi/Antara Foto/Via ReutersRescue teams worked overnight to evacuate the victims. On Thursday morning, they recovered the body of a boy who had been trapped beneath the overturned bus. He died during the rescue attempt. Some survivors were sent to a nearby clinic and a hospital, and two died during treatment.Television footage showed relatives lining the halls of a hospital and a morgue in Sumedang.Budi Setiyadi, the director general of land transportation for Indonesia\u2019s transport ministry, said in a statement on Wednesday, \u201cWe express deep concern and condolences for this incident.\u201dMr. Budi said that officials were considering adding guard rails to the road or paving it as they continued to investigate the accident.Steep valleys and ravines are common along Indonesian highways because it has so much mountainous terrain. A lack of adequate street lighting and poor infrastructure lead to regular traffic accidents.On average, three people in Indonesia died every hour from road accidents in the first quarter of 2020, according to the transport ministry.The authorities said the student group had traveled some six hours from their homes to pay their respects at the tomb of Syekh Abdul Muhyi, a missionary who brought Islam to the Tasikmalaya region after the mid-17th century, when Hinduism was still the primary religion in the surrounding territory.The students, teachers and parents were visiting the site on the eve of a national holiday marking the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad.Some Muslim families visit the graves of relatives on Islamic holidays, using the occasion for outdoor picnics. While some Islamic leaders oppose the practice of pilgrimage at the burial sites of missionaries, others allow it.ImageWreckage from the accident on Thursday.Credit...Ahmad Fauzan/Associated Press",

Three more vaccines, Novavax, CureVac and Sputnik V, are undergoing a rolling review, a preliminary step that could lead to approval. The decision on Thursday opens the door for the delivery of 200 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the European Union, under a contract that includes an option for 200 million more.Those supplies could help speed up the bloc\u2019s vaccination efforts, which have gotten off to a sluggish start. So far, only 6.5 percent of the European Union\u2019s 450 million residents have been inoculated, far behind the rates in Britain, Israel or the United States.But the first deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccine are not expected in Europe before April. The bloc also said on Thursday that it would extend for another three months, to the end of June, a mechanism that permits member states to prevent the export of vaccines made within the bloc\u2019s borders if the manufacturers have not filled all their orders at home. Data published Wednesday by The New York Times showed that the European Union has been exporting millions of vaccine doses, even as member nations\u2019 efforts to vaccinate their own citizens have been slowed by shortages and other problems.The bloc has come under fierce criticism over the mechanism to restrict exports. Accusations of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d intensified last week when Italy used the mechanism to block a shipment of doses bound for Australia.Since the mechanism was put in place in February, officials have approved 249 export permits, covering more than 34 million doses bound for 31 different countries. They were approved \u201cbecause they did not threaten the contractual arrangement between the E.U. and the vaccine producers,\u201d said Miriam Garc\u00eda Ferrer, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. \u201cOnly one export has been refused,\u201d she added.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

        "full_article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans and Democrats finally agree on something: The pandemic rescue bill President Biden signed into law on Thursday is the largest expansion of government support programs in more than 50 years. Where they differ is on whether that is good or bad.Trying to undermine the widely popular $1.9 trillion legislation, Republicans are denouncing the bill as \u201cthe most progressive domestic legislation in a generation.\u201d They call it a spending spree that amounts to \u201ca massive expansion of the entitlement system,\u201d funds a longstanding \u201clist of liberal priorities\u201d and was muscled through on a party-line vote by Democrats unwilling to lower its price tag in drawn-out negotiations with Republicans. Democrats proudly own every word of that description.\u201cIf you are a Democrat charged with that, you\u2019d better prove yourself guilty,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania.The question for Republicans is whether they can get away with excoriating a bill that will deliver tangible benefits in the form of cash, tax credits, help paying child care and health care expenses, and much more to millions of Americans who have struggled for a full year with financial devastation and uncertainty.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/1:21-0:00transcriptBiden Signs $1.9 Trillion Covid-19 Relief BillPresident Biden signed a historic $1.9 trillion economic relief package into law Thursday afternoon, a day earlier than the White House had planned, ushering in new federal aid across the country amidst the coronavirus pandemic.It\u2019s clear that an overwhelming percentage of the American people \u2014 Democrats, independents, our Republican friends \u2014 have made it clear, the people out there, made it clear they strongly support the American Rescue Plan.

You haven\u2019t had to care for a relative, a child who\u2019s not been able to go to school,\u2019\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky and the chairman of the Budget Committee. He predicted that Republicans would eventually \u201cshow up at every ribbon cutting, for every project that\u2019s funded out of this bill, and they\u2019re going to pump up their chest and take credit for all of these great benefits that are coming to their citizens.\u201d\u201cVote no and take the dough,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi cracked.Republicans said that was not their plan, particularly after Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, was ridiculed this week for denouncing and voting against the bill, only to take to Twitter once it passed and applaud the inclusion of $28 billion for restaurateurs. That was just a few days after he had criticized the bill as packed with \u201cunnecessary spending that will overheat the economy at a time when infections are dropping nationwide.\u201dRepublicans are aware their comments on the measure will be watched carefully for evidence of hypocrisy. Party officials said they doubted others would follow Mr. Wicker\u2019s lead \u2014 though it is a time-honored congressional tradition to try to win accolades for federal spending the public likes while complaining about the overall cost.Privately, some top Republicans said they believed their pushback against the bill had been weak and too heavily focused on process, allowing Democrats to gain the upper hand with their celebration of the extensive help they are providing.With the congressional debate done, the rush is now on by both parties to define the bill that is likely to be a main point of contention in next year\u2019s midterm elections, as Democrats seek to retain their thin majorities in the House and the Senate against a Republican onslaught.ImageSenator Roger Wicker was ridiculed this week for voting against the bill but then applauding the inclusion of money for restaurateurs after it passed.Credit...Anna Moneymaker for The New York TimesHours after Mr. Biden signed the bill on Thursday, Ms. Pelosi issued a news release titled \u201cRepublican Lawmakers May Not Want to Check Their Local News,\u201d packed with headlines from Republican congressional districts around the country hailing the measure\u2019s passage and its benefits for each community.The Republicans\u2019 approach is to label the measure wasteful, unnecessary and packed with goodies for political allies of the Democrats. They argue that it is aimed at providing bailouts for fiscally strapped states and cities run by Democrats, paid for with taxes from their own red-state constituents, although the measure makes funding available to all states.\u201cMy hardworking Iowans shouldn\u2019t be paying to balance the budgets of states that have not been able to manage theirs, when Iowa does a tremendous job of taking care of our finances,\u201d said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa.Republicans are also trying to grab credit of their own for any economic rebound that may materialize, arguing that it was their party\u2019s earlier efforts when they controlled the Senate and the White House that have delivered vaccines, brought the economy to the brink of a comeback and gotten the pandemic under control.\u201cWe\u2019re on our way out of this,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, declared on Wednesday. \u201cWe are about to have a boom. And if we do have a boom, it will have absolutely nothing to do with this $1.9 trillion.\u201d.css-yoay6m{margin:0 auto 5px;font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-weight:700;font-size:1.125rem;line-height:1.3125rem;color:#121212;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-yoay6m{font-size:1.25rem;line-height:1.4375rem;}}.css-1dg6kl4{margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:15px;}.css-k59gj9{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;width:100%;}.css-1e2usoh{font-family:inherit;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:justify;-webkit-justify-content:space-between;-ms-flex-pack:justify;justify-content:space-between;border-top:1px solid #ccc;padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;background-color:#fff;}.css-1jz6h6z{font-family:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-size:1rem;line-height:1.5rem;text-align:left;}.css-1t412wb{box-sizing:border-box;margin:8px 15px 0px 15px;cursor:pointer;}.css-hhzar2{-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform ease 0.5s;-webkit-transition:transform ease 0.5s;transition:transform ease 0.5s;}.css-t54hv4{-webkit-transform:rotate(180deg);-ms-transform:rotate(180deg);transform:rotate(180deg);}.css-1r2j9qz{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg);-ms-transform:rotate(0deg);transform:rotate(0deg);}.css-e1ipqs{font-size:1rem;line-height:1.5rem;padding:0px 30px 0px 0px;}.css-e1ipqs a{color:#326891;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-e1ipqs a:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-1o76pdf{visibility:show;height:100%;padding-bottom:20px;}.css-1sw9s96{visibility:hidden;height:0px;}#masthead-bar-one{display:none;}#masthead-bar-one{display:none;}.css-1cz6wm{background-color:white;border:1px solid #e2e2e2;width:calc(100% - 40px);max-width:600px;margin:1.5rem auto 1.9rem;padding:15px;box-sizing:border-box;font-family:'nyt-franklin',arial,helvetica,sans-serif;text-align:left;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-1cz6wm{padding:20px;width:100%;}}.css-1cz6wm:focus{outline:1px solid #e2e2e2;}#NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION .css-1cz6wm{border:none;padding:20px 0 0;border-top:1px solid #121212;}Frequently Asked Questions About the New Stimulus PackageHow big are the stimulus payments in the bill, and who is eligible?The\u00a0stimulus\u00a0payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. Those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. To qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. For heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. To be eligible for a payment, a person must have a Social Security number. Read more. What would the relief bill do about health insurance?Buying insurance through the government program known as COBRA would temporarily become a lot cheaper. COBRA, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. But it\u2019s expensive: Under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. Under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire COBRA premium from April 1 through Sept. 30. A person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before Sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. And someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either. Read moreWhat would the bill change about the child and dependent care tax credit?This credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. More people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. The bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. \u201cThat will be helpful to people at the lower end\u201d of the income scale, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Read more.What student loan changes are included in the bill?There would be a big one for people who already have debt. You wouldn\u2019t have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation \u2014 for example, if you\u2019ve been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if Congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. This would be the case for debt forgiven between Jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025. Read more.What would the bill do to help people with housing?The bill would provide billions of dollars in rental and utility assistance to people who are struggling and in danger of being evicted from their homes. About $27 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance. The vast majority of it would replenish the so-called Coronavirus Relief Fund, created by the CARES Act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. That\u2019s on top of the $25 billion in assistance provided by the relief package passed in December. To receive financial assistance \u2014 which could be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses \u2014 households would have to meet several\u00a0conditions. Household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic. Assistance could be provided for up to 18 months,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance.

Trump gone from the White House and Democrats now in charge of the House and the Senate, Republicans have resurrected their warnings about soaring federal deficits and the debt being piled on future generations while also sounding the alarm about inflation.\u201cYou are going to see gas prices going up, interest rates going up, mortgage rates going up, car loans going up, prices at the grocery store going up,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chamber\u2019s No. 3 Republican. \u201cPeople are going to be bothered.\u201dDemocrats argue that Republicans sound a little desperate in their efforts to stoke public opinion against the measure. Republicans succeeded in the 2010 midterm elections by accusing Democrats of wasteful spending through a stimulus and Wall Street bailout after an economic crisis. But Democrats believe those complaints have less salience today, particularly since the pandemic is more on the order of a natural disaster, not a crisis created by profit-seeking bankers.They contend that the public appreciates and supports what they are doing, and is willing to spend what it takes to put down the pandemic and return life to the normal that Americans crave. Republicans will regret their stance, they say.\u201cThis bill is historic in magnitude, and so is the disconnect between Republicans and reality \u2014 both the political reality and the economic background,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201c\u2018It is too big; it is too much.\u2019 That\u2019s their story and they are sticking to it. But people know that it is better to overshoot when you are in this kind of thing.\u201d\u201cThe more people learn,\u201d he added, \u201cthe more they like.\u201d",

That allowed him to expand eligibility to the state\u2019s next two phases at the same time \u2014 and \u201cweeks ahead of schedule.\u201dAnd at least 37 states, as well as Washington, D.C., are now allowing some residents with certain health problems to receive vaccines, according to a New York Times survey, though the conditions that confer access in one state may not do so in another.The Coronavirus Outbreak \u203aLatest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0March 18, 2021, 11:04 a.m. ETHomelessness rose for the fourth straight year, a report says, but the data doesn\u2019t yet reflect the pandemic.Europe\u2019s vaccine rollout is too slow, the W.H.O. says.A U.S. agency pledges to reimburse families for Covid-19 funeral costs.The pace of vaccinations has picked up to the point where the daily average of individual shots has reached about 2.17 million a day. On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed.

Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

The surrounding area had no street lamps. As their bus was making a turn on a narrow, downhill stretch of the Wado-Malangbong Highway in Sumedang, West Java Province, it appears that the brakes failed, the police said.The vehicle, carrying a total of 66 people \u2014 including the students from a school in Subang, their teachers and family members \u2014 plunged into the ravine, killing 29, including the bus driver. Eleven others were seriously injured.The police were still investigating the cause of the accident, said a police spokesman, Dedi Juhana, but a lack of skid marks on the road suggested that the brakes had malfunctioned.He said that the bus had dropped some 65 feet in a valley surrounded by farmland in Sumedang. The site of the accident was a government-owned road frequently used by commuters traveling between provinces.ImageMoving one of the victims.\u00a0The vehicle had been carrying 66 people, officials said.Credit...Raisan Al Farisi/Antara Foto/Via ReutersRescue teams worked overnight to evacuate the victims. On Thursday morning, they recovered the body of a boy who had been trapped beneath the overturned bus. He died during the rescue attempt. Some survivors were sent to a nearby clinic and a hospital, and two died during treatment.Television footage showed relatives lining the halls of a hospital and a morgue in Sumedang.Budi Setiyadi, the director general of land transportation for Indonesia\u2019s transport ministry, said in a statement on Wednesday, \u201cWe express deep concern and condolences for this incident.\u201dMr. Budi said that officials were considering adding guard rails to the road or paving it as they continued to investigate the accident.Steep valleys and ravines are common along Indonesian highways because it has so much mountainous terrain. A lack of adequate street lighting and poor infrastructure lead to regular traffic accidents.On average, three people in Indonesia died every hour from road accidents in the first quarter of 2020, according to the transport ministry.The authorities said the student group had traveled some six hours from their homes to pay their respects at the tomb of Syekh Abdul Muhyi, a missionary who brought Islam to the Tasikmalaya region after the mid-17th century, when Hinduism was still the primary religion in the surrounding territory.The students, teachers and parents were visiting the site on the eve of a national holiday marking the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad.Some Muslim families visit the graves of relatives on Islamic holidays, using the occasion for outdoor picnics. While some Islamic leaders oppose the practice of pilgrimage at the burial sites of missionaries, others allow it.ImageWreckage from the accident on Thursday.Credit...Ahmad Fauzan/Associated Press",

Three more vaccines, Novavax, CureVac and Sputnik V, are undergoing a rolling review, a preliminary step that could lead to approval. The decision on Thursday opens the door for the delivery of 200 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the European Union, under a contract that includes an option for 200 million more.Those supplies could help speed up the bloc\u2019s vaccination efforts, which have gotten off to a sluggish start. So far, only 6.5 percent of the European Union\u2019s 450 million residents have been inoculated, far behind the rates in Britain, Israel or the United States.But the first deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccine are not expected in Europe before April. The bloc also said on Thursday that it would extend for another three months, to the end of June, a mechanism that permits member states to prevent the export of vaccines made within the bloc\u2019s borders if the manufacturers have not filled all their orders at home. Data published Wednesday by The New York Times showed that the European Union has been exporting millions of vaccine doses, even as member nations\u2019 efforts to vaccinate their own citizens have been slowed by shortages and other problems.The bloc has come under fierce criticism over the mechanism to restrict exports. Accusations of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d intensified last week when Italy used the mechanism to block a shipment of doses bound for Australia.Since the mechanism was put in place in February, officials have approved 249 export permits, covering more than 34 million doses bound for 31 different countries. They were approved \u201cbecause they did not threaten the contractual arrangement between the E.U. and the vaccine producers,\u201d said Miriam Garc\u00eda Ferrer, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. \u201cOnly one export has been refused,\u201d she added.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons.

And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

That allowed him to expand eligibility to the state\u2019s next two phases at the same time \u2014 and \u201cweeks ahead of schedule.\u201dAnd at least 37 states, as well as Washington, D.C., are now allowing some residents with certain health problems to receive vaccines, according to a New York Times survey, though the conditions that confer access in one state may not do so in another.The Coronavirus Outbreak \u203aLatest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0March 18, 2021, 11:04 a.m. ETHomelessness rose for the fourth straight year, a report says, but the data doesn\u2019t yet reflect the pandemic.Europe\u2019s vaccine rollout is too slow, the W.H.O. says.A U.S. agency pledges to reimburse families for Covid-19 funeral costs.The pace of vaccinations has picked up to the point where the daily average of individual shots has reached about 2.17 million a day. On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

        "title": "8 New Books We Recommend This Week - The New York Times",
        "full_article": "Sometimes a book sells itself: Oh, Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s new novel is a mournful allegory about artificial intelligence and the challenges of human connection? Sign me up, please! (But even if you\u2019re on the same page, do make time to read Radhika Jones\u2019s lovely review of the book; you\u2019ll be glad you did.) Other times a good review makes all the difference. That was the case this week with Mary Roach\u2019s wonderful take on \u201cThis Is the Voice,\u201d by John Colapinto, an in-depth nonfiction book about the larynx. Trust me, you\u2019ll want to read it after you read the review.No? That\u2019s OK, we\u2019re all about options. We also suggest a couple of memoirs, one by the psychologist Sherry Turkle and one by the journalist Theo Padnos about his two-year captivity in Syria. We recommend a study of fashion and its cultural significance over the last millennium or so, and \u2014 going back further still \u2014 a history of soldiers in the Roman Army. And in fiction, along with the Ishiguro, we also like Susan Conley\u2019s \u201cLandslide\u201d and Angie Thomas\u2019s \u201cConcrete Rose,\u201d a prequel to \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d that puts Starr Carter\u2019s father, Maverick, front and center.Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowlesTHE EMPATHY DIARIES: A Memoir, by Sherry Turkle. (Penguin Press, $28.) Turkle is a clinical psychologist and a thinker about the ethics of technology and online life who has taught for decades at M.I.T. In this memoir, written with a warm, intimate voice, she writes about growing up in postwar Brooklyn in a semi-observant Jewish family. She evokes the hothouse atmosphere at Radcliffe and Harvard in the late 1960s, when she was an undergraduate. She writes about studying in Paris in the early 1970s, when she got to know the controversial French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. \u201cThe Empathy Diaries\u201d is a \u201cbeautiful book,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes. \u201cIt has gravity and grace; it\u2019s as inexorable as a fable; it drills down into the things that make a life; it works to make sense of existence on both its coded and transparent levels; it feels like an instant classic of the genre.\u201dKLARA AND THE SUN, by Kazuo Ishiguro. (Knopf, $28.) Klara, the solar-powered humanoid who narrates the Nobelist Ishiguro\u2019s powerful eighth novel, is an \u201cArtificial Friend,\u201d purchased as a companion to a sickly teenage girl. Through the robot\u2019s eyes, and haunting mechanical voice, we encounter a near future in which technology, ominously, has begun to render humans themselves obsolete. Klara\u2019s perception \u201cis at once mechanical and deeply subjective,\u201d Radhika Jones writes in her review. \u201cSeeing the world from Klara\u2019s point of view is to be reminded constantly of what it looks like when mediated through technology. That might have felt foreign a century ago, but not anymore.\u201dGLADIUS: The World of the Roman Soldier, by Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re. (University of Chicago, $30.) This comprehensive account about what it was like to be in the Roman military offers many surprises about the lives of ordinary soldiers 2,000 years ago, among them the fact of widespread literacy in the troops. \u201cThe biggest surprise,\u201d Thomas E. Ricks writes in his latest column about military history, \u201cmay be that the Roman Army, though hardly a hotbed of individualism, provided us with the first time in Western history that large numbers of ordinary people left records of who they were, where they came from, what they did and where they did it \u2014 usually on their tombstones.\u201dLANDSLIDE, by Susan Conley. (Knopf, $26.95.) In this enveloping novel, a mother of teenage boys tries to find her footing in coastal Maine after her husband is injured in a fishing accident. Little cracks have sprouted in every inch of the fortification around this family\u2019s life, and Conley shows their battle to keep vulnerability at bay. \u201cShe has a gift for writing tiny, meaningful interactions,\u201d Hillary Kelly writes in her review. \u201cWhat is a mom to do with boys these days? That\u2019s not a question with an answer \u2014 nobody but the sanctimonious, it seems, really knows precisely how to make good men.\u201dTHIS IS THE VOICE, by John Colapinto. (Simon & Schuster, $28.) Colapinto makes the case that our larynx \u2014 the human voice box \u2014 may be the most important boost evolution bestowed. His exploration charges off in consistently fascinating directions, including the delightful, data-based revelation that humans can reliably hear a smile. Our reviewer, Mary Roach, calls it an \u201cexemplary\u201d book, \u201cequally illuminating and entertaining\u201d: Colapinto, she says, \u201cargues that we are hard-wired to be drawn to and moved by the human voice. It may not be over the top to suggest, as he does, that the soul, in some sense, resides in the larynx.\u201dBLINDFOLD: A Memoir of Capture, Torture, and Enlightenment, by Theo Padnos. (Scribner, $27.) Padnos, a freelance American reporter who dreamed of covering the war in Syria, ended up getting kidnapped and held hostage there instead. His account of his nearly two-year ordeal is sensitive, insightful and often wry, not least about his own na\u00efve and misguided impulses. \u201cLike many hostage memoirs, \u2018Blindfold\u2019 lays bare the human condition at its extremes,\u201d Declan Walsh writes in his review. \u201cThere is depravity and resilience, rage and revelation, and, ultimately, a triumph of the human spirit. Padnos, however, takes the journey a step further, using his fluent Arabic to engage with his captors, probing their motives and prejudices, not to mention the psychology of a wartime community that appears to be in thrall to a fundamentalist ideology.\u201dDRESS CODES: How the Laws of Fashion Made History, by Richard Thompson Ford. (Simon & Schuster, $30.) Taking readers around the world from the 1200s to today, Ford embarks on an ambitious and comprehensive exploration of how fashion has been used by people both with and without money and power. \u201cTo help readers understand why we dress the way we do, Ford chronicles the fashion crimes of various eras,\u201d Tariro Mzezewa writes in her review, \u201cillustrating the rigidity and cruelty of social norms as enforced through sartorial laws. Joan of Arc, Ford reminds us, was tried and burned for heresy, in part because she violated religious morality by wearing men\u2019s clothing.\u201dCONCRETE ROSE, by Angie Thomas. (Balzer + Bray, $19.99.) This Y.A. novel, a prequel to the popular \u201cThe Hate U Give,\u201d follows its 17-year-old hero as he learns he\u2019s going to become a father, considers leaving his gang and envisions his family legacy. Despite these challenges, a \u201cfamiliar hum of collective care is woven throughout \u2018Concrete Rose\u2019 and showcases the full humanity of Black folks \u2014 and Black boys in particular,\u201d Martha Tesema writes in her review.",

        "full_article": "The European Union authorized use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on Thursday, amid mounting frustration with a sluggish inoculation campaign that has been hobbled by supply shocks and logistics failures, and with global wars over scarce doses ratcheting up.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, issued the authorization a few hours after the 27-member bloc\u2019s main drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, approved the vaccine for use in people 18 and up.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can be stored in regular fridges for up to three months and only requires one shot, is the fourth to be approved by the regulatory agency. Three more vaccines, Novavax, CureVac and Sputnik V, are undergoing a rolling review, a preliminary step that could lead to approval. The decision on Thursday opens the door for the delivery of 200 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the European Union, under a contract that includes an option for 200 million more.Those supplies could help speed up the bloc\u2019s vaccination efforts, which have gotten off to a sluggish start. So far, only 6.5 percent of the European Union\u2019s 450 million residents have been inoculated, far behind the rates in Britain, Israel or the United States.But the first deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccine are not expected in Europe before April. The bloc also said on Thursday that it would extend for another three months, to the end of June, a mechanism that permits member states to prevent the export of vaccines made within the bloc\u2019s borders if the manufacturers have not filled all their orders at home. Data published Wednesday by The New York Times showed that the European Union has been exporting millions of vaccine doses, even as member nations\u2019 efforts to vaccinate their own citizens have been slowed by shortages and other problems.The bloc has come under fierce criticism over the mechanism to restrict exports. Accusations of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d intensified last week when Italy used the mechanism to block a shipment of doses bound for Australia.Since the mechanism was put in place in February, officials have approved 249 export permits, covering more than 34 million doses bound for 31 different countries. They were approved \u201cbecause they did not threaten the contractual arrangement between the E.U. and the vaccine producers,\u201d said Miriam Garc\u00eda Ferrer, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. \u201cOnly one export has been refused,\u201d she added.",

Reimagined by the Los Angeles-based architect Miggi Hood, alongside her business partners Yola Jimenez, of Yola Mezcal, and the entrepreneur Marie Cazalaa, the property is an amalgam of the old and the new: The original three-story building, which was completed in 1962, connects to another three-story structure erected by the local architecture firm Estudio Atemporal in 2019. Guests enter through a whitewashed lounge with vaulted brick ceilings, over a dozen works by the American abstract painter James H. D. Brown and midcentury-inspired chairs upholstered in cream vinyl. The four rooms in the main house are accessible via a stucco staircase and feature details like a wooden partition by the Spanish Modernist designer Eugenio Escudero and arched wooden bed frames by the contemporary Los Angeles-based artists Ingemar Hagen-Keith and Tallulah Hood. Through a marble-tile atrium with red volcanic-rock walls, and a covered courtyard with a Valentine Schlegel-inspired dipping pool of Hood\u2019s design, is the new building. A spiral staircase forged from steel leads from one of the additional rooms to the other, each with curved oak doors crafted by the local furniture studio Taller Nacional, along with woven stools and shag rugs by the design firm Txt.ure that recall the designs of Luis Barrag\u00e1n. Both buildings offer rooftop terraces, where guests can enjoy views of the magnificent stained-glass windows of the church next door.

But Gemma Greenhill, the co-founder of the Oakland, Calif.-based shoe label Santa Venetia, was after something a little different than the ones typically offered: \u201cYou see a lot of funnel-neck fleeces with company names emblazoned on the front, but it\u2019s not my aesthetic,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted a jacket that met a comfort need and a style need.\u201d So she stitched together a checkered fleece whose cropped yet roomy silhouette was based on that of a beloved vintage military jacket. The handmade piece fetched enough compliments that Greenhill decided to launch a new label. Gr\u00f6n Kulle, named for the Swedish translation of her surname (Greenhill, who is British and identifies as mixed race, only recently became aware of her Scandinavian heritage), offers eye-catching fleeces available in three styles that come with either an open or zippered front. There\u2019s the Noor, which has a large yin-yang motif on the back; the Moonrise, whose patchwork pieces resemble a night sky; and the Lu, which has a checker print. Each style is offered in a variety of colors, including persimmon, sage and buff, and the pieces are sustainable, made to order in small batches from dead-stock fabric salvaged from rag mills in Los Angeles and New York. As Greenhill notes, the patterns are also well suited to being admired from a distance. \u201cThey\u2019re bold enough that they look interesting from 10 feet away,\u201d she says.

For Shimojo, who splits her time between New York and Kyoto, Japan, and the gallery\u2019s owner, Yng-Ru Chen \u2014 who cut her teeth at MoMA PS 1, the Asia Society and Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 March 11 is heavy with meaning: It marks the 10th anniversary of Japan\u2019s deadly Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, which together claimed nearly 16,000 lives, and which inspired this body of work. When Shimojo heard news of the disaster in 2011, she was in her studio in New York and was struck by a report describing the sakura, or cherry blossom trees, blooming amid the wreckage. To soothe her grief, she began to paint their petals. \u201cI started to see each one as a life,\u201d Shimojo says. The resulting work, \u201cSakura\u201d (2011-13), a muted swirl of pastel pink, white and light gray, led to four others, each rendered in Japanese ink on Khadi paper and taking a circle as its form \u2014 an orb of burgundy, a spiral of forest green, an amalgam of blue dots that look almost like an iris \u2014 a gesture toward the cyclical nature of life. Those works are included in the exhibition along with a new site-specific installation, in which a single sakura petal, made from washi paper and suspended on a thread, hangs above a mound of salt and 108 glass petri dishes, each containing its own washi petal. A dazzling light projection, created by Maria Takeuchi, and contemplative soundscape, composed by Alec Fellman, accompanies the installation. \u201cMemento Mori\u201d is dedicated to the victims of the Tohoku disaster and of Covid-19, and is a reminder of nature\u2019s formidable power \u2014 as well as its resilience. \u201cMemento Mori\u201d is on view through April 18, 313A Harvard Street, Brookline, Mass., praiseshadows.com.read ThisRecipes From a Seasoned RestaurateurImageLeft: the cover of \u201cMister Jiu\u2019s in Chinatown.\u201d Right: oxtail soup, which is featured in the cookbook.Credit...Pete LeeBy Kurt SollerSince opening in 2016, Mister Jiu\u2019s has remained one of the most exciting Chinese restaurants in the United States: an ode as much to chef Brandon Jew\u2019s Ying Ying \u2014 his paternal grandmother \u2014 as to its neighborhood, San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, which he and his collaborator, Tienlon Ho, call \u201cthe birthplace of Chinese-American food\u201d in their new cookbook, \u201cMister Jiu\u2019s in Chinatown,\u201d out this week. As with the restaurant that informed these recipes and techniques, Jew\u2019s mission is to expose people to \u201ca little of this and little of that,\u201d whether it\u2019s modern or traditional, American or Chinese, inspired by the Bay Area or somewhere farther afield. The result is a beautifully photographed project that\u2019s both faithful and innovative \u2014 there\u2019s sourdough in the green onion pancakes, peanut butter in the hoisin sauce \u2014 as well as technical yet conversational: \u201cCooking is really the study of water,\u201d the authors declare when introducing a quick recipe for fried Taiwanese eggplant. But that\u2019s not to say this isn\u2019t a real restaurant cookbook, and there are plenty of captivating projects \u2014 a roast duck that takes nine pages to detail and around two weeks to execute \u2014 for those who\u2019ve bored themselves with workaday quarantine cooking (or have perhaps become more skilled in the kitchen). And if you can\u2019t bear the sight of your knives these days, the book still makes for great reading: on cultural touchstones like lazy susans and pleated pot stickers; and on a place \u2014 and one of its leading chefs \u2014 that continues to define contemporary American cuisine.buy ThisCovetable Jewelry Carved From BoneImageLeft: R\u00e9gis de Saintdo\u2019s Anna pendant, made from hand-carved bone and natural turquoise. Right: the designer\u2019s Aurore earrings, made of bone and colored glass.Credit...Courtesy of R\u00e9gis de SaintdoBy Rima SuqiMany jewelers find beauty in ordinary objects \u2014 smooth pebbles, delicate shells \u2014 but R\u00e9gis de Saintdo perhaps more so than most. Years ago, the Parisian maker, who spent over two decades working for the designers Elizabeth Garouste and Mattia Bonetti before going out on his own, started saving veal and beef bones he\u2019d procured from his local butcher, simply because he liked their shape. He then bleached, sanded and carved one of them, with the intention of turning it into a gift for his wife. The resulting geometric pendant, which he accented with red coral, attracted a slew of admirers who wanted one of their own. In the four years since, de Saintdo, who also designs home accessories, has expanded his repertoire to include pieces made from palm nuts (also known as vegetable ivory) and cherry wood (from an old tree at his family\u2019s home in Burgundy), which he garnishes with pearls, coral, amber, amethyst and howlite that\u2019s dyed to look like turquoise. De Saintdo delights in the challenges his chosen materials present: \u201cBone is quite thin and curvaceous, and there might be cracks or holes inside the wood,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do anything you want.\u201d The resulting one-of-a-kind rings, earrings and pendants are fairly minimalist, brought to life by the color and texture of the gems that adorn them.

Book Covers: Modern Library; Harry Ransom Center, the University of Texas at Austin; Restless BooksThank you to all those who joined us for the third installment of T Book Club last night. The event \u2014 featuring a discussion between the novelist Brit Bennett and T features director Thessaly La Force on Nella Larsen\u2019s classic 1929 novel, \u201cPassing,\u201d in which two old friends, both Black women, reunite in 1920s Harlem despite the fact that one of them is living as a white person \u2014 can be watched (or rewatched) here. An essay about the book, by Bennett, who first read it in college and, years later, would write her own novel about racial passing, can be found here. The next T Book Club pick is \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley\u201d by Patricia Highsmith. We hope you\u2019ll read along, and R.S.V.P. to the virtual conversation on that novel, to be led by Edmund White and held on April 22.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons.

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons.

Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

        "full_article": "The European Union authorized use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on Thursday, amid mounting frustration with a sluggish inoculation campaign that has been hobbled by supply shocks and logistics failures, and with global wars over scarce doses ratcheting up.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, issued the authorization a few hours after the 27-member bloc\u2019s main drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, approved the vaccine for use in people 18 and up.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can be stored in regular fridges for up to three months and only requires one shot, is the fourth to be approved by the regulatory agency. Three more vaccines, Novavax, CureVac and Sputnik V, are undergoing a rolling review, a preliminary step that could lead to approval. The decision on Thursday opens the door for the delivery of 200 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the European Union, under a contract that includes an option for 200 million more.Those supplies could help speed up the bloc\u2019s vaccination efforts, which have gotten off to a sluggish start. So far, only 6.5 percent of the European Union\u2019s 450 million residents have been inoculated, far behind the rates in Britain, Israel or the United States.But the first deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccine are not expected in Europe before April. The bloc also said on Thursday that it would extend for another three months, to the end of June, a mechanism that permits member states to prevent the export of vaccines made within the bloc\u2019s borders if the manufacturers have not filled all their orders at home. Data published Wednesday by The New York Times showed that the European Union has been exporting millions of vaccine doses, even as member nations\u2019 efforts to vaccinate their own citizens have been slowed by shortages and other problems.The bloc has come under fierce criticism over the mechanism to restrict exports. Accusations of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d intensified last week when Italy used the mechanism to block a shipment of doses bound for Australia.Since the mechanism was put in place in February, officials have approved 249 export permits, covering more than 34 million doses bound for 31 different countries. They were approved \u201cbecause they did not threaten the contractual arrangement between the E.U. and the vaccine producers,\u201d said Miriam Garc\u00eda Ferrer, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. \u201cOnly one export has been refused,\u201d she added.",

There was little hint in the backgrounds of Franklin Delano Roosevelt or Lyndon Baines Johnson that they would help lift millions out of poverty. There wasn\u2019t any with President Biden either.The brutal toll that the past year has taken and the income inequality that has accelerated left the Democrats with an opportunity they needed to seize. Mr. Biden is the president for this time.The Republicans, who unanimously rejected the aid package, appear to be in a race to irrelevance. Congressional Republicans might be better served by breaking free from the past and working to legislate instead of castigate.Elliott MillerBala Cynwyd, Pa.To the Editor:Not only will the legislation just passed by the Democrats represent bold relief for many Americans, but it also represents, hopefully, the first step in a grand reinvestment in American life. For far too long, we have allowed the wealth of the nation to spiral upward into too few hands.If the public continues to support the promised Democratic initiatives, a next step will be to invest in the public infrastructure of the nation \u2014 a public infrastructure that not only redresses decades of neglect but also points us to the future.Perhaps some Republicans will begin to join the march toward a better today and tomorrow. No doubt, there are still some with useful ideas to add. It is time for Republicans to get back in the game with an eye toward winning for all Americans.Bruce NeumanWater Mill, N.Y.To the Editor:It is thrilling news that the stimulus bill has passed to battle the pandemic and poverty, with extended unemployment, food and rent relief, and tax credit expansions that could cut poverty in America by one-third.Thank you, Mr. President and Congress, for protecting us from the pandemic and its economic fallout, while putting America on the road to equity!Willie DickersonSnohomish, Wash.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons.

And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov.

Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

That allowed him to expand eligibility to the state\u2019s next two phases at the same time \u2014 and \u201cweeks ahead of schedule.\u201dAnd at least 37 states, as well as Washington, D.C., are now allowing some residents with certain health problems to receive vaccines, according to a New York Times survey, though the conditions that confer access in one state may not do so in another.The Coronavirus Outbreak \u203aLatest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0March 18, 2021, 11:04 a.m. ETHomelessness rose for the fourth straight year, a report says, but the data doesn\u2019t yet reflect the pandemic.Europe\u2019s vaccine rollout is too slow, the W.H.O. says.A U.S. agency pledges to reimburse families for Covid-19 funeral costs.The pace of vaccinations has picked up to the point where the daily average of individual shots has reached about 2.17 million a day. On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

        "full_article": "The European Union authorized use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on Thursday, amid mounting frustration with a sluggish inoculation campaign that has been hobbled by supply shocks and logistics failures, and with global wars over scarce doses ratcheting up.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, issued the authorization a few hours after the 27-member bloc\u2019s main drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, approved the vaccine for use in people 18 and up.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can be stored in regular fridges for up to three months and only requires one shot, is the fourth to be approved by the regulatory agency. Three more vaccines, Novavax, CureVac and Sputnik V, are undergoing a rolling review, a preliminary step that could lead to approval. The decision on Thursday opens the door for the delivery of 200 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the European Union, under a contract that includes an option for 200 million more.Those supplies could help speed up the bloc\u2019s vaccination efforts, which have gotten off to a sluggish start. So far, only 6.5 percent of the European Union\u2019s 450 million residents have been inoculated, far behind the rates in Britain, Israel or the United States.But the first deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccine are not expected in Europe before April. The bloc also said on Thursday that it would extend for another three months, to the end of June, a mechanism that permits member states to prevent the export of vaccines made within the bloc\u2019s borders if the manufacturers have not filled all their orders at home. Data published Wednesday by The New York Times showed that the European Union has been exporting millions of vaccine doses, even as member nations\u2019 efforts to vaccinate their own citizens have been slowed by shortages and other problems.The bloc has come under fierce criticism over the mechanism to restrict exports. Accusations of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d intensified last week when Italy used the mechanism to block a shipment of doses bound for Australia.Since the mechanism was put in place in February, officials have approved 249 export permits, covering more than 34 million doses bound for 31 different countries. They were approved \u201cbecause they did not threaten the contractual arrangement between the E.U. and the vaccine producers,\u201d said Miriam Garc\u00eda Ferrer, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. \u201cOnly one export has been refused,\u201d she added.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons.

Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

Diana spoke of the unhappiness of their marriage, her mental health struggles and an eating disorder. The candor of the interview divided the country.On Sunday, Diana\u2019s younger son, Prince Harry, and his wife, Meghan, gave a similarly shocking television interview, in which they opened up about their travails within the royal family.Today, we look at the similarities between these two interviews, given 25 years apart.On today\u2019s episodeSarah Lyall, a writer at large for The New York Times.ImageDiana, Princess of Wales, being interviewed about palace life in 1995.

About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck.

At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",

The production, a blend of contemporary dance and Broadway spectacle, became an international sensation and, a quarter century later, was one of the last seen on New York City Center\u2019s stage before Covid-19 arrived.Now it\u2019s the first of four full-length performances that make up Matthew Bourne\u2019s New Adventures Festival, available through April 4 on the City Center website for $15 each, or $50 for all four.\u201cSwan Lake,\u201d online through Sunday, is followed by \u201cThe Car Man,\u201d which transplants Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d to an oil-stained garage and diner in 1960s America (Friday to March 21). Then come Bourne\u2019s \u201cCinderella,\u201d set in London during the Blitz (March 19-28), and his \u201cRomeo & Juliet,\u201d which commits the star-crossed lovers to an institution for troubled youth (March 26-April 4).BRIAN SCHAEFERTheaterWays to Mark a Lost YearImageJose Llana and\u00a0Nikki M.

When a house is empty, a ghost light keeps spirits at bay. When a luminary dies, marquees are dimmed. And when a big anniversary rolls around, people gather to observe it \u2014 because in an art form built for evanescence, it\u2019s important to tend to the history.There is no sugarcoating the sadness of marking one year this week since the pandemic shutdown of the theater. With assembling en masse to commemorate it still unsafe, we are left to make our separate ceremonies, solemn or celebratory. Take your pick.For my own, there will be music: Shaina Taub\u2019s buoyant, funny demos for her adaptations of \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d and \u201cAs You Like It\u201d (both on Bandcamp); the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast album, of course; and the cast album of Tim Minchin\u2019s playful, longing \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d because here we are, a year later, still trapped in a pandemic.LAURA COLLINS-HUGHESPop & RockHelping Fellow Musicians in NeedImageJhen\u00e9 Aiko will be among the performers at the MusiCares virtual benefit concert on Friday.Credit...Aaron J. Thornton/Getty ImagesBefore the glam teams swoop in and the red carpet is unfurled, several nominees at Sunday\u2019s Grammy Awards will lend their talents to a virtual benefit concert for the Recording Academy\u2019s charitable wing, MusiCares, which provides financial and medical support to musicians in need.Among the performers are Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, whose sensuous third record, \u201cChilombo,\u201d is a contender for album of the year, and the sister group Haim \u2014 Aiko\u2019s competitors \u2014 who will flaunt the breezy Californian rock that earned them a nomination for \u201cWomen in Music Pt. III.\u201d H.E.R., a Recording Academy darling up for song of the year with her protest track \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d will supply contemporary R&B flecked with old soul. BTS and John Legend are also on the bill. To supplement the new performances, MusiCares plans to air archival footage featuring Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty and more.Tickets to the broadcast, which starts at 8 p.m. Eastern on Friday, are available for $25 at musicares.org.OLIVIA HORNkidsFrom Poses to PiImageAniko Greger, left, and Ilona Reddy doing a seated spinal twist.

So why not try some relaxing movement?That\u2019s the purpose of \u201cYoga Dreamland,\u201d a new release from Putumayo World Music that consists of an album of soothing international melodies accompanied by a booklet featuring yoga poses for children 4 and older. (Parents can order the physical CD and booklet for $14.98 or download them for $10 on Putumayo\u2019s website.)On Saturday at 7 p.m. Eastern time, Sean Johnson, the project\u2019s co-creator, will stream a free Facebook Live celebration of its debut from Wild Lotus Yoga, his New Orleans studio. (A recording of the event will remain on Putumayo\u2019s Facebook page afterward.) While hearing album tracks from places like Senegal and Tibet, youngsters will learn moves like the child\u2019s pose, the bridge and, ultimately, the restful savasana.Want to stretch their minds, too? On Sunday, visit the National Museum of Mathematics\u2019 virtual Pi Day 2021 for an exploration of that intriguing number.

It is available for download on Bandcamp on Friday.Credit...Andres Gonzalez for The New York TimesThe Resonant Bodies Festival featured an excellent lineup of vocal virtuosos during its run between 2013 and 2019. Some level of surprise was always around the corner, since invited singers enjoyed a free hand regarding programming. But the New York-based organization\u2019s quality control also produced a reliably top-notch roster.For those who missed out on the festivities, an archival release from the festival\u2019s founders is due out on Friday, on the New Focus imprint. Two preview tracks, available online at the label\u2019s Bandcamp page, give a sense of the festival organizers\u2019 widely ranging appreciation for contemporary vocal music.Pamela Z\u2019s 2018 set offers a take on her early, Minimalist-influenced composition \u201cBadagada,\u201d as well as the less-often heard soundscape work \u201cQuatre Couches.\u201d And an excerpt from the singer Arooj Aftab\u2019s improvised performance with the pianist Vijay Iyer and the bassist Shahzad Ismaily \u2014 from the final festival in 2019 \u2014 exhibits both the poise and the pan-stylistic curiosity familiar from her studio albums.SETH COLTER WALLS",

That allowed him to expand eligibility to the state\u2019s next two phases at the same time \u2014 and \u201cweeks ahead of schedule.\u201dAnd at least 37 states, as well as Washington, D.C., are now allowing some residents with certain health problems to receive vaccines, according to a New York Times survey, though the conditions that confer access in one state may not do so in another.The Coronavirus Outbreak \u203aLatest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0March 18, 2021, 11:04 a.m. ETHomelessness rose for the fourth straight year, a report says, but the data doesn\u2019t yet reflect the pandemic.Europe\u2019s vaccine rollout is too slow, the W.H.O. says.A U.S. agency pledges to reimburse families for Covid-19 funeral costs.The pace of vaccinations has picked up to the point where the daily average of individual shots has reached about 2.17 million a day. On March 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 2.9 million shots had been delivered.Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months, either by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose vaccine or by the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C.President Biden has steadily moved up the nation\u2019s inoculation timeline as the vaccine makers have increased production \u2014 in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s case, by entering a partnership with a longtime rival, Merck. After announcing last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine available by the end of May for every American adult, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that he was directing the federal government to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.The White House said that the additional doses could help the country begin to vaccinate children after the necessary clinical trials are completed. The doses could also, if necessary, be used as boosters or be reformulated to combat emerging variants of the virus.Utah is making all adults eligible for the vaccine on April 1 for more local reasons. After the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature moved to end the state\u2019s mask mandate, Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, \u201cworked with them to push the date back to get as many people vaccinated as possible\u201d beforehand, a spokeswoman for the governor, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, said in a statement on Tuesday. Utah\u2019s mask requirement will end April 10, at which point the state plans to have 1.5 million doses available, she said.Local authorities have also opened eligibility to wider populations. At some clinics in the Navajo Nation, which underwent harsh lockdowns this summer and suffered from a surge in cases, anyone 16 and older can get a vaccine. And in Gila County, Ariz., any resident over the age of 18 can walk into a clinic and get a shot.But vaccine hesitancy remains a potential obstacle to the nation\u2019s energized vaccination campaign. Health officials in Alaska have said that hesitancy, combined with confusion about eligibility, had left unfilled appointments, which may have factored into the governor\u2019s decision to swing the doors to the vaccine wide open.While Alaska has fully vaccinated 16 percent of its population, the highest rate in the country, according to a New York Times database, the state ranks 46th in vaccine administration, having used only 69 percent of its supply.",
